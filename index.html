        Ruber Band Powered Car
          <p>This is a car made for children 3+, This car is safe to use. The car is a hybrid meaning it has an electric engine or a rubber band to make it go. You can unscrew the fan and it can go on the electrig engine or on the rubber band engine. The car is made of plastic so its quite durable, if a part of the car breaks you can probbably replace it with materials you can find at home or a 9V battery if it runs out of juice.
